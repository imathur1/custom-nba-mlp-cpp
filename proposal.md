### Proposed Project
- Implement a basic machine learning model from scratch 
- The model will predict the likelihood that a college basketball player will be drafted into the NBA
- Gather college basketball statistics from public datasets to train our model
- Code mathematical models to train on the data and predict the output with increasing accuracy

### Features
- Multi-layer perceptron neural network
- Implementation of mathematical models

### Plan
- Find datasets with the necessary data
- Research the math and logic behind simple machine learning models
- Implement the model in C++
- Train the model on the data
- Write the necessary catch2 tests
### Third-party Libraries/Datasets
- Kaggle
- Catch2
